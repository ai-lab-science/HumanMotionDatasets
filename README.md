# HumanMotionDatasets
Datasets of human motions recorded using motion capturing systems
This data is generated according to the paper (Honghu Xue, Rebecca Herzog, Till M Berger, Tobias Bäumer, Anne Weissbach, Elmar Rueckert , ‘Using Probabilistic Movement Primitives in analyzing human motion differences under Transcranial Current Stimulation’). 

The file includes the post-processed trajectory data for each subject. We present 10 subjects as mentioned in the paper.

Each .npy file features a numpy array of dimension (2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 100, 2). For further information of the 3rd dimension, please read 'A description.docx'.
